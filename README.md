# local-web-server
At its core, local-web-server is an application shell for building a specialised command-line web server to support productive Web Platform engineers. When combined with built-in and custom features it's in intended to by a powerful tool in helping build and debug Web applications. It comes bundled with a middleware stack covering common requirements but any arbitrary stack can be specified from the command line or config.

Being an npm module, it is trivial is bundle and distribute/deploy with your web application.

**Typically used for building:**

* Simple static site
* Single Page Application
  * Works well with React, Angular or vanilla JS.

**Backend scenarios covered:**

* Existing API
* Mock API
* Websocket server

**Server options**

* HTTP or HTTPS server
  * HTTPS is strictly required by some modern techs (ServiceWorker, Media Capture and Streams etc.)
* Configurable middleware stack
  * Use any combination of built-in and custom middleware
  * specify options (for command line or config)
  * Accepts Koa v1 or 2 middleware

**Built-in Middleware stack**

  * Rewrite routes to local or remote resources
  * Efficient, predictable, entity-tag-powered conditional request handling (no need to 'Disable Cache' in DevTools, slowing page-load down)
  * Configurable log output, compatible with [Goaccess, Logstalgia and glTail](https://github.com/75lb/local-web-server/blob/master/doc/visualisation.md)
  * Proxy server
    * Map local routes to remote servers. Removes CORS pain when consuming remote services.
  * Back-end service mocking
    * Prototype a web service, microservice, REST API etc.
    * Mocks are defined with config (static), or code (dynamic).
  * CORS-friendly, all origins allowed by default.

**Personalised stack**
